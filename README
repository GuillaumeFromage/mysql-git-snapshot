This is a tool to commit databases in git, so you can easily diff amongst
versions, and see which tables are affected by what changes you might be
doing on the front end (of a website for example). It was developped as a
utility to test a lot of work done to migrate drupal 6 to drupal 7, so I
can easily get back to previous versions amongst the steps I'm doing, but
I think the tool as some value in itself.
